<p>It doesn’t matter if you have just been to Paris or New York, a tiny ski town in Colorado or a sandy-island off the coast of Peru. There is something about coming home to Vancouver, all fresh and green and human-scaled, that makes your heart skip a beat. Travel far-and-wide, explore the globe, see the sights: coming home to our city of glass, nestled between the mountains and the sea, makes you feel great.</p>

<p>Another thing: have you noticed that when you are away, and someone asks you where you are from, it’s a very good moment in your day? It’s because there’s a brief second or two of anticipatory pleasure that comes from knowing you have the best possible answer. “Me? I live in Vancouver,” you say. And you are quietly thrilled to be asked.</p>

<p>Saying “I’m from Vancouver” will almost always be met with an expression of envy, or a story about a memorable vacation at some time in the past. It may even elicit a wistful confession that while Vancouver is high on the bucket list, it just hasn’t happened yet. “Someday soon,” your new acquaintance will say, she “hopes to make it there,” because she’s heard “it’s beautiful.”</p>

<h3>Why is that? What is it about Vancouver?</h3>

<p>The answer is a very unique-to-Vancouver recipe, a collusion and sometimes even a collision of factors. The answer lies in the way nature and culture, tradition and innovation, technology and craftsmanship co-exist here. It’s in how we are bustling and relaxed, global and local, competitive and caring.</p>

<p>Our city is an internationally famous cosmopolitan jewel, surrounded by towering alpine peaks that slope down to ancient rainforests which eventually give way to warm sandy shorelines and wave-polished driftwood and that one small seashell you found on the beach this morning.</p>

<p>What if you could take all these qualities that make Vancouver so special, and bring them together, so they could be close to you always? What if your own home, the place where you wake up every morning and act out the daily rituals of life, made you feel the way Vancouver makes you feel?</p>

<blockquote>No one has ever built a condominium tower to tell the Vancouver story. No one has ever captured the feeling of Vancouver, and used concrete and steel to bring it into your home. Until now.</blockquote>

<p>In this building, The Harwood, for the first time Vancouver becomes an adjective, a way to describe what we’ve done.</p>

<p>It starts with a location in the most Vancouver of all Vancouver neighbourhoods, the leafy green West End. Roughly bordered by Stanley Park, downtown, and the ocean, you are surrounded here by the most famous features of the city you love.</p>

<p>You are between the fast-paced business district and endless ocean waves, near bustling shops and quiet parks.</p>

<p>You live in a contemporary tower that features the latest technology and luxury finishes, in a private-park setting that feels as leafy and green as any suburban boulevard, and maybe even more. This is a study in contrasts that feels very Vancouver indeed.</p>

<p>This small community of condominiums, just 75 suites, have views and light and space that feel distinctly Vancouver. There is artwork outside by Vancouver’s most beloved and famous son, Douglas Coupland, and his influence does not stop at the door. He worked side-by-side with well-known Vancouver companies Strand and Intracorp to imagine an entire living experience, one that is unique to Vancouver.</p>

<h3>This couldn’t be anywhere but here.</h3>

<p>Furnishings come from Vancouver. Tables and chairs and fixtures are sourced locally too. Every surface, all the wood and stone we could find comes from around Vancouver. Even the UV bandwidth of the light bulbs mimics natural sunlight, to remind you of sun-dappled walks through forested Stanley Park, or walks on the beach, or runs in the powder, regardless of time of day or time of year.</p>

<p>These homes make your heart skip a beat each time you open your door.  You’ll have to be consciously careful not to brag. These homes are inspired by Vancouver as an idea, an idea made tangible and real, an idea that you can live in, and feel truly at home.</p>
