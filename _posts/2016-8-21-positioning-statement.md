The world wants to live in Vancouver, and The Harwood is Vancouver, at its best. The ideas and ideals that Vancouver is known for around the world have created this place. It’s entirely unique: no one else has attempted to interpret the Vancouver brand as a building. 

All the stories, features, and amenities at The Harwood relate back to what makes us all proud to call Vancouver home. Both the City of Vancouver and The Harwood are Green & Natural, Contemporary, Leading-Edge, Creative, Safe & Respected, and Bustling yet west-coast-relaxed.

These 75 very unique condominiums in Vancouver’s iconic West End are designed for Downsizers, Upgraders and Collectors looking to own a piece of Vancouver, both literally and philosophically. Our owners will be excited/proud about what makes this city, our home, the best place in the world.
