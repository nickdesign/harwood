description: Five perspectives on what the brand stands for
---

<h2>Perspective 1: Brand Ambition</h2>
<h3>What we are striving to be known for:</h3>

<div class="box-blur">Everything that makes Vancouver such a unique and amazing city, interpreted as a condominium tower.</div> 

---

<h2>Perspective 2: Brand Purpose</h2>
<h3>What makes us unique:</h3>

<div class="box-blur">Everything about Vancouver is reflected in this work. This building could only be here. It’s an opportunity to celebrate the city we all love!</div>

---

<h2>Perspective 3: Brand Values</h2>
<h3>Characteristics that are key to the institution:</h3>

<div class="box-blur">
<p><strong>Simplicity:</strong> Everything is here for a reason. There are no gargoyles or flourishes inside or out. Like Vancouver does, we invite you to make this place uniquely yours.</p>

<p><strong>Uniqueness:</strong> No one else has attempted to interpret the Vancouver brand as a building. All our stories, features, amenities relate back to what makes us proud to call Vancouver home.</p>

<p><strong>Technologically right:</strong> Technology that makes life better; not bells-and-whistles that will be out-of-favour next week. This is about technology that is almost invisible, yet essential to improving the homeowner experience.</p>

<h2>Perspective 4: Brand Essence</h2>
<h3>The philosophy that drives us forward, <br />our institutional DNA:</h3>

<div class="box-blur">The world wants to live in Vancouver, and The Harwood is Vancouver, at it’s best.</div>

---

<h2>Perspective 5: Brand Promise</h2>
<h3>Our commitment to our audiences:</h3>

<div class="box-blur">Your home at The Harwood will feel like Vancouver. The ideas and ideals that make this city so special have created this place. It’s entirely unique and could only ever be here.</div>
