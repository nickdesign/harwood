For a Vancouver building of this stature in the IPL/Strand portfolio, it’s vital that we find a way to talk about the offering that crosses demographic boundaries. We don’t want to be one thing. We want to be many. 


This building is an opportunity to appeal to Asians and Non-Asians, to bring downsizers from the Westside and West Van together, to mix what previous internal documents have referred to as The Upgraders with The Downsizers and The Collectors. 


So, we commissioned research with 200 Asian and non-Asian prospects in the area, ready to move in the next two years, for whom luxury product is a motivating factor. We wanted to find the places where their personal understandings of luxury overlapped with sources of luxury, and where those overlapping points met the real estate market. 


We conducted a meta-study of secondary research about how luxury is being expressed in the real estate industry in cities around the world, to see what we could learn. 


And we studied luxury retailers in other sectors to find guiding principles for how luxury brands with far more resources than we have at our disposal are changing brand messages and meanings to appeal to the new luxury consumer in the most engaging way possible. 


All of this work culminated in a session with the senior project team from sales, marketing, and development. We pared down the collected information and agreed on the core principles reflected in this brand strategy document. 


We discovered that we have an abundance of connections to the luxury motivators shared by all our audiences: the latest materials/experiences as expressed through technology and uniqueness. The brand strategy has been created with these guiding principles in mind. These are the uniting factors that will make this building work for everyone it was designed to work for. 


In short, this building is more than a real estate offering. It is an opportunity to showcase what we can do when we focus on what makes us great, and what we have in common with each other. 


The Harwood is a declaration that we are all in this together, and that wouldn’t have it any other way.
